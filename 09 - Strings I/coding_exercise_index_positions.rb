# The method should return true if the first and last character are equal,

# The => indicates the expected return value
#
# same_first_and_last_letter("runner")   => true
# same_first_and_last_letter("Runner")   => false
# same_first_and_last_letter("clock")    => false

# The method should calculate the sum of the digits of the string.

# Examples:
# The => indicates the expected return value
#
# three_number_sum("123")   => 6
# three_number_sum("567")   => 18
# three_number_sum("444")   => 12
